 <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a computational social scientist interested in human learning and language. I use a wide range of methods including behavioral experiments, NLP techniques, and analysis of large trace data. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at <a    "https://www.cmu.edu/"> Carnegie Mellon University </a>in the Department of Psychology, and Department of Social and Decision Sciences.

     
<br> <br>
I earned my PhD in Psychology from Stanford University where I worked with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/">Michael C. Frank</a>. I was then a post-doctoral scholar with James Evans  (U of Chicago) and Gary Lupyan (UW-Madison). Before graduate school, I studied linguistics at Reed College. I have  <a href = "./publications.html">  authored 15+ articles in peer-reviewed journals </a>, including <em> Nature Human Behavior</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, and <em>Psychological Science</em>. My work has been featured in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-dozens-of-languages-help-build-gender-stereotypes/">Scientific American</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90537064/these-are-the-most-gender-biased-languages-in-the-world-hint-english-has-a-problem">Fast Company</a>, and  <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article256879467.html?fbclid=IwAR2HaVU90vA6C8S8R9lIRQv1eFEvjeBNB0-3zSl0Urrd31PRRlTCGPPBwQ8">The Kansas City Star</a>.

 <h2>Recent work </h2>


  <h3>Gender bias in language models</h3>

 <p> In several recent papers, I've examined the extent to which word co-occurrence statistics in language corpora contain subtle information about gender stereotypes, and how humans might learn this information.

 In <a href=
                "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0918-6" target="_blank" class = "paperlink"> Lewis and Lupyan (2020, <em>NHB</em>)</a>, we measured how strongly people who spoke different languages held a particular gender stereotype (woman as associated with home life; men with careers), and then measured the strength of that stereotype in the co-occurrence  statistics of the language they spoke. We found a strong correspondence between the two: people who speak languages that strongly encode this stereotype, tend to have speakers that also strongly encoded this stereotype. You can see slides from a presentation of this work above.

 In <a href=
                "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976211024643" target="_blank" class = "paperlink">  Lewis, et al. (2021, <em> Psych. Science</em>)</a>, we examined how gender was represented in a corpus of popular children's books  (e.g.,  <em>Curious George</em>, <em>Pat the Bunny</em>). </p>

      <h3>Cross-linguistic variability in meaning</h3>

 <p> In another line of work, we've been trying to understand the ways in which representations of meaning vary across groups of people. In one project  <a href=
                "https://psyarxiv.com/f5bvp" target="_blank" class = "paperlink">  (Lewis, Cahill, Madnani, &amp; Evans, under revision)</a>, we've examined this question through  word embedding models trained on second-language text. A key finding from this work is that languages vary more in terms of their "global" semantic relations, relative to "local" ones.

 In a related project, we've analyzed millions of sketches from the <a href=
                "ttps://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" class = "paperlink">  Google QuickDraw dataset</a>. The plot below shows the prototypical “bread” in each country, calculated as the drawing with the smallest average pairwise distance to other drawings from the same country  <a href=
                "https://psyarxiv.com/p4s7d" target="_blank" class = "paperlink"> (Lewis, Balamurugan, Zheng, &amp; Lupyan, 2021) </a>. </p>

     <h2>Teaching</h2>

     <p>At Carnegie Mellon, I teach an R-based research methods course, <a href="https://cumulativescience.netlify.app/"> Modern Research Methods</a>.  The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the process of cumulative science, and to introduce them to a set of modern tools for conducting science in this framework. </p> 

     <h2>Other</h2>

     <p>I love exploring found data, visualizing complex datasets, and making <a href="https://mlewis.shinyapps.io/namesemantics/"> interactive dashboards</a>. When not playing with data, I enjoy backpacking and baking pie &#127856
